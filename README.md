The purpose of this repository is to teach new users of the Houston Robotics Group the basics of electronics. This will be a repository that's continually updated to provide more lessons/concepts.

The user can currently learn:

## Arduino
1. How to up an Arduino board - downloading the Arduino IDE, creating sketches, connecting an Arduino board to a computer
2. The basics of programming in the Arduino IDE - basic data types, functions, and parts of the Arduino program/sketch
3. Create a first project - 'Blink'
