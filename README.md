# Learn Electronics

## Purpose of Repository:

This repository was created for my own reference but also for the Houston Robotics Group. I will continue to update this repository from my own notes and learning but also any feedback.

## What you'll find:
1. Process for creating projects - from idea to implementation (Refer to "START HERE" directory)
2. Design process for creating projects (Refer to "START HERE" directory)
3. Project ideas (Refer to "START HERE" directory)
4. References for (1) important electronic concepts, (2) essential components, (3) additional components, (4) tools
5. Programming basics for the Arduino programming language

## How I recommend you should learn:
1. Think of a project idea - project ideas can be found in the "START HERE" directory
2. Look over the process for both creating a project and the design process
3. Understand the essential electronic concepts
4. Refer to the component explanations needed for your project
5. Iterate back and forth between the 3rd and 4th points
