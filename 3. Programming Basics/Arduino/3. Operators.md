# Operators

Arithmetic operators perform math operations. Logical operators are used in conditions.

int sum = 5 + 3; // Arithmetic operator
if (sum == 8 && buttonState == HIGH) { // Logical operator
// code if condition is true
}

## Practice Problems:

### Problem 1

Use arithmetic operators to calculate the area of a circle with a radius of 5. (Area = PI \* radius^2).

### Problem 2

Use a comparison operator to check if two int variables, a and b, are not equal. Print "Not Equal" if they are not.

### Problem 3

Use logical operators to check if a number num is between 1 and 10. Print "Within range" if true.
