# 3. LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes)

## Function:

LEDs are a type of diode that emit light when electricity passes through them.

## Why Essential:

They are a simple way to learn about diodes and how to control electronic components with a microcontroller.

# Additional Information:

The LED has two leads (or legs) - one that's longer, and one that's shorter.

# Anode (Longer Leg)

## Function:

The anode is the positive leg of the LED. It is typically the longer of the two legs.

## Purpose:

The anode is where the current enters the LED. When connected to the positive side of the power supply (and the cathode is connected to the negative side), it allows current to flow through the LED, causing it to emit light.

# Cathode (Shorter Leg)

## Function:

The cathode is the negative leg of the LED and is usually shorter than the anode.

## Purpose:

The cathode is where the current exits the LED. It must be connected to the negative side of the power supply for the LED to work.

# Importance of Correct Orientation:

Understanding and identifying the anode and cathode is crucial because LEDs are diodes, which means they only allow current to flow in one direction â€“ from the anode to the cathode. If an LED is connected backward, it will not light up. Moreover, applying reverse voltage can damage the LED.

# Summary

In summary, the two legs of an LED are distinct and serve different functions in a circuit.

The longer leg (anode) is positive and should be connected to the positive side of the power source, while the shorter leg (cathode) is negative and connects to the negative side.

Correctly identifying and connecting these legs is essential for the proper functioning of the LED.
