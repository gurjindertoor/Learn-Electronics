# 2. Capacitors

## Function:

Capacitors store and release electrical energy. They can also filter or smooth out electrical signals.

#### Why Essential:

They are used for tasks like smoothing out power supply fluctuations, in timing circuits, and as part of signal processing circuits.

## Value of Knowing:

Understanding capacitors is valuable as they store and release electricity, which is crucial for stabilizing power supply and filtering out noise in circuits.
