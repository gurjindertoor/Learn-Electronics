# 2. Basic Components and their Functions:

1. Resistors: Act like narrow parts in a pipe that restrict water flow. They control how much electricity flows through a part of the circuit.

2. Capacitors: Like small water tanks that store and release water. They store electricity temporarily and release it when needed, helping to manage the power supply in a circuit.

3. LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes): Little lights that glow when electricity passes through them, like a waterwheel that lights up when water flows over it.
4. Diodes: One-way valves for electricity, ensuring it flows in only one direction, much like a check valve in a water pipe.

Value: Each component plays a unique role in controlling and managing electricity in a circuit. Knowing how they work allows you to build functional and diverse electronic projects.
Importance in Electronics: These components are the building blocks of electronics, allowing you to create everything from simple light circuits to complex computers.
