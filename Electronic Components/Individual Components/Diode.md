# Diode

## What is it?

A diode is a component that only lets electricity flow in one direction.

## How does it work?

Itâ€™s like a one-way street for electricity, preventing the current from flowing backward.

## Use Case:

Preventing backflow of current in a power supply.

## Used With:

Capacitors (in power supplies), transformers (in AC to DC conversion), resistors (for current limiting).
