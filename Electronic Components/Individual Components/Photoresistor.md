# Photoresistor

## What is it?

A photoresistor changes its resistance based on how much light it gets.

## How does it work?

In the dark, it stops electricity from flowing well; in light, it lets more electricity through.

## Use Case:

Turning on a light automatically when it gets dark.

## Used With:

LEDs, resistors, and transistors or relays for switching.
