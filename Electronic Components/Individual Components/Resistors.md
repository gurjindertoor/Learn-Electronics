# Resistors

## What is it?

Resistors control the flow of electrical current in a circuit.

## How does it work?

They are like traffic cops for electricity, slowing down the flow to prevent damage to other components.

## Use Case:

Limiting current to LEDs to prevent them from burning out.

## Used With:

Almost every electronic component, like LEDs, transistors, and ICs.
