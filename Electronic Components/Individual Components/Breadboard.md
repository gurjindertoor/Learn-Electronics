# Breadboard

## What is it?

A breadboard is a rectangular plastic board with a bunch of tiny holes in it. These holes let you easily insert and connect electronic components without soldering.

## How does it work?

Inside, there are strips of metal that connect the holes in rows or columns, allowing electricity to flow between inserted components.

## Use Case:

Prototyping a new electronic circuit design.

## Used With:

Almost all components like resistors, capacitors, LEDs, transistors, and integrated circuits.
