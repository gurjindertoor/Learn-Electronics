## What is it?

A transistor is a tiny switch that controls the flow of electricity.

## How does it work?

It can turn a current on or off, or amplify it, acting as a gatekeeper for electrical signals.

## Use Case:

Switching and amplifying signals in circuits, in logic gates, amplifiers, or switching devices.

## Used With:

Resistors, capacitors, diodes, microcontrollers.
