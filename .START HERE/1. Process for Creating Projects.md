# Process for Creating New Projects

This process is meant to be used as a roadmap to go from an electronics idea you have to implementing it.

Before you begin: Keep a record of your process, challenges, and solutions to reflect on at the end, to learn from, and to show off!

## 1. Idea and Goal Setting

### Define your project idea:

What exactly do you want to build or achieve? (e.g. a temperature sensor, a robotic arm, etc.)

### Requirements:

What must the project do? Consider the key functionalities as well as performance, size, power consumption, etc. - this will help you figure out

### Set clear goals:

What are the key functionalities your project should have? Consider performance, size, power consumption, etc.

## 2. Basic Research

### Explore similar projects:

Look for projects or tutorials that resemble your idea for inspiration, insights, or understanding.

### List necessary components:

Identify the basic components you'll need - like sensors, LEDs, etc.

### Skill assessment:

Identify any skills or gaps in knowledge you need to build on for the project (e.g. programming, components you lack knowledge of, soldering, etc.)

## 3. Design and Plan

### Sketch your design:

Draw a basic diagram of your project, including how components connect - doesn't have to be perfect, just an idea for you to start wrapping your head around so you know how things will look or work (and it's perfectly okay to change the design as you go)!

### Outline the steps:

Break down your project into smaller, achievable steps.

## 4. Prototype and Code

### Build a prototype:

Assemble a simple version of your project.

### Write basic code:

Start with simple code to make your components work - you can often find preexisting libraries, snippets of code, or open source projects where you can get code.

## 5. Test and Troubleshoot

### Test each part:

Make sure each component and your code are working.

### Troubleshoot:

Fix any issues that arise during testing.

## 6. Refine and Finalize

### Make improvements:

Based on your testing, refine your projects for better performance.

### Final assembly:

Put together your final project.

## 7. Document and Share

### Document your work:

Reemphasizing the point from the start - keep a record of your process, code, and challenges.

### Share your project:

Don't forget to share all your hardwork with others! It can serve as a great example for others and let you get feedback if desired but other than that, show off your project!

## Optional: 8. Continously Improve Project:

Continue to improve the project by adding additional functionalities until you're satisfied.
