# Guide to Electronic/Robotic Design

## Step 1: Define the Goal

- Identify Purpose: Decide what your project should do. Determine what it needs to sense or receive (inputs) and what actions it should perform (outputs).

## Step 2: Plan the Parts

- Break It Down: Divide your project into smaller sections (blocks).Each block represents a part of your device's function.
- Fill in the Blocks: Start deciding what each block does, focusing on the key functions first.
- Complete the Blocks: Make sure each block's function is fully planned.

## Step 3: Design Layout

- Start Layout: Plan how to arrange these blocks on a board (like a physical layout).
- Finish Layout: Adjust and finalize the arrangement for efficiency and space.

## Step 4: Build and Test

- Prototype: Build a prototype using a simple board (protoboard) or a custom PCB. Gather all necessary parts.
- Assemble and Test: Put everything together and test to see if it works.

## Step 5: Troubleshoot

- Fix Issues: If there are problems, identify and solve them (debugging).
- Iterate: Go back and improve your design if necessary.

## Step 6: Repeat and Refine

- Refine Until Successful: Continue testing, fixing, and improving until the device works as intended.

## Key Points

- Learning and Adapting: It's normal to encounter challenges. Each problem is a chance to learn.
- Iterative Process: Designing and building electronic/robotic projects is often a process of trial and error. Keep refining your design.
