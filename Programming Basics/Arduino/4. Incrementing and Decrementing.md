# Incrementing and Decrementing

These operations increase or decrease the value of a variable, often used in loops.

```
int counter = 0;
counter++; // Increment by 1
counter--; // Decrement by 1
```

## Practice Problems:

### 1.

Create a variable counter and initialize it at 0. Increment it five times using a loop.

### 2.

Initialize a variable x to 10. Write a loop that decrements x until it reaches 0.

### 3.

Create a variable num at 100. Use a for loop to decrement it by 2 each time until it's less than or equal to 90.
