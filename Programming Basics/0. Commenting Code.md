# Commenting Code

Comments are non-executable lines in your code that explain what it does, making it easier to understand. Double slashes are used proceeded with the comment - see example below.

```
// Turn on the LED for one second, then off for one second
digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
delay(1000);
digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
delay(1000);
```
